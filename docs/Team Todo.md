# Team Todo

Here is where we can record things we know we need to. Add whatever you think is necessary. We'll collect them and discuss them as a team before we implement them.

## Process

Here's the process we'll follow:

1. Discuss the idea and what it means.
2. What impact would we experience by doing nothing or implementing the idea?
3. How difficult will it be to implement the idea?
4. Which team member(s) will implement the idea?


## Sample

"Mr Hurrell has an idea to add a button to the Match Scouting home screen that, when clicked, will display a QR Code representing the URL to the Scouting App. Clicking another button will either dismiss the QR Code or return to the Match Scouting home screen."
